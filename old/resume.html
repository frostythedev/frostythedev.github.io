            <p>I am the Founder of Vision Coding LLC which is software based programming team and later company founded in the middle-age of 2015. This team was made in the hope of providing a solution to the continuously growing business industry and was
                later aimed at Minecraft Server Development. Throughout this time the company has acclaimed a total exceeding $2,250 USD by the summer of 2015 and has since then been in the process of being reworked to better adapt to the modernization
                and demand of newer innovation and application. <br></p>

            <p>My employment at KastiaMC was contracted for the time period of 4 months after our initial contact on the project “WarOnKastia” was extended for our outstanding work and performance. My team as well as I was very dedicated to making the server
                the best that it could be during this time and were open to expanding the network into bigger, larger things. A few other projects that we left was a completely redone Server Management Core (“KastiaCore”) and our newest bit of A.I known
                as “CheatBot” targeted at enhancing a better PvP experience for all. Overall our time as this network was very well spent and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience. <br></p>

            <p>In late 2014 I took my chances at applying at TheParkMC as a part time developer as they were very popular for their well-known mini-game known as Cauldron Battles. The server had taken a short break and was looking to regain its roots where
                I was accepted under contract for 3 months. Within these 3 months I made several mini games including Cauldron Wars (Remastered), Simon Says and Musical Pigs which I would say were all of intimidate difficulty, all being ready for launch
                for the server in late December, unfortunately there were management changes during this time and my contract was extended for 9 more down to the launch of &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the server last month. I have left quite a bit
                of my work at the server and hope that it excels to its fullest potential. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p>

            <p>My employment at Savage Games was contracted for the time period of 3 months after our initial contact on the project “Skybounds”. I was assigned to manage bug fixes which included taking community feedback and identifying problems which affected
                the mechanics of the game itself as well as Quality Assurance where I worked alongside the systematic workflow of weekly updates as well as documenting and testing new features which reached the live servers. Overall this experience enhanced
                my ability to work alongside a dedicated team and working efficiently to meet strict deadlines. <br></p>
